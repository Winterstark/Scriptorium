Ep-Py
=====

This is a simple Python script that looks up the title of a TV episode on tvrage.com.
It accepts the path to the file (or directory containing the file) as the argument; after obtaining the title it renames the file (based on the user's format) and moves it to the destination directory.

It is highly recommended to make a shortcut to the script in your Send To directory ("%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo" in Win7) so you can easily right-click the file/folder and select Send To > ep.py
